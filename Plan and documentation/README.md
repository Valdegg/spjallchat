# spjallchat
Simple group chat client in php


Spjall is a small, invite-only web chat built for friends who want a shared place to talk without relying on large messaging platforms. 
It is focused on group conversation rather than feeds or profiles, with a single lobby, direct messages, and simple ad-hoc group chats formed by selecting participants. The system is intentionally minimal: real-time plain-text messaging, visible online presence, and persistent history, with no roles, moderation layers, or social mechanics. Spjall aims to be easy to host, easy to understand, and stable over time, serving as an independent space for ongoing conversations among people who already know each other.
